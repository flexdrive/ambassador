# This image is the base _runtime_ for Ambassador. No compilers or
# other toolchains, just the basics and the external Golang
# dependencies that Ambassador needs. It's used as a base image in the
# main Dockerfile, so that we can use the Docker cache to more
# effectively dodge network issues re-downloading the Golang stuff.
#
# If you have to change this file (e.g. if you switch to a new rev of
# a Golang dependency), you _must_ update BASE_GO_RELVER in the
# Makefile, then run "make docker-update-base" to build and push the
# new image.
